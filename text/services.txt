Gtechniq Crystal Serum Light (Paint Protection Option) {
    Product Details
- Serum Light forms an ultra- durable, high-gloss, slick to the touch, chemically bonding inorganic layer of 9h optically clear ceramic.  Once applied, gloss levels will remain in the upper 90th percentile for significantly longer when compared to traditional paint protection products, and cleaning your car will be a breeze.                                                                                                                    
- The high density ceramic layer is resistant to chemicals ranging from pH2 - pH12.  This characteristic also makes bonded contaminants such as tree sap, tar, and hard water spots, easy to remove.                                                                 
- Unlike mainstream wax and organic polymer coatings, Serum and Serum Light can resist much higher and lower temperatures.  They resist temperatures as low as -40o to as high as +250°c.
